* [One-liner exception handling](test/com/diffplug/common/base/ErrorsExample.java?ts=4) for Java 8 functional interfaces (even with checked exceptions).
* A [simple replacement](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/StringPrinter.html) for the mess of `PrintStream`, `OutputStream`, `Writer`, etc. when all you want is to pipe some strings around.
* Given a node in a tree, and a [`Function<Node, List<Node>>`](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/TreeDef.html), create a `Stream` for [traversing](test/com/diffplug/common/base/TreeStreamTest.java?ts=4) this tree (breadth-first, depth-first, etc.).
* An [enum for handling comparisons](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/Comparison.html) in a pattern-matchey way.
* Guava's [`Suppliers`](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/Suppliers.html),
[`Predicates`](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/Predicates.html),
and [`Functions`](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/Functions.html) converted to Java 8,
and a new [`Consumers`](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/Consumers.html) class to round it out.
* A few other carefully-curated Java 8 goodies:

	+ [Either](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/Either.html)
	+ [StackDumper](https://diffplug.github.io/durian/javadoc/3.0/com/diffplug/common/base/StackDumper.html)
